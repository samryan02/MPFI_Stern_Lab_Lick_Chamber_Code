Code for the operation of the lick chambers designed by the Max Plank Institute for Nueroscience Mchanical Workeshop for the Stern Lab

Ardunio code is interupt based and is designed to run on an arduino mega with a serial speed of 9600

Python code displays and saves values recoded by the arduino by using matplot lib and the creation of a CSV file. To run this code 
one must import the pyserial, and matplotlib libraries.

For serial communitcation plase find the serial port for your particualr device and copy and paste this into the code, this can be done using the arduno IDE or the arduino web editor, please note that the serial ports have diffrent naming convention in windows and Mac OS.

Currently the arduino shech is set to run a 30 minute experiment how this can be esialy changed
